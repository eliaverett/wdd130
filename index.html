        <p>Hello! My name is Eli Averett, and I am from Ucon, Idaho. I am a student studying software engineering
            and

        <p>My state is a great one! I grew up here and recently moved back. Most people will complain about how cold it
            is, and it definitely is cold. However, there is so much beauty here and we are surrounded by national
            parks. We are also of course known for potatoes! </p>
