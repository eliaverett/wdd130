            <h2> About Me </h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Eli Averett, and I am from Ucon, Idaho. I am a student studying software
                engineering and web development. I love all things technology and hope to be a full-stack developer one
                day.
                Right now, I am currently working as a web design/developer for a small non-profit start up out of Utah.
                We
                help kids who are really struggling socially, emotionally, or mentally to be able to find the sources
                that
                they need to go to in order to find friends and help. I love working with languages such as HTML, CSS,
                and
                Python in order to accomplish any company's goals. I appreciate any opportunity I have to be able to
                learn
                from others how to better my code, and more efficently accomplish projects that for any business.

            <p>My state is a great one! I grew up here and recently moved back. Most people will
                complain about how cold it
                is, and it definitely is cold. However, there is so much beauty here and we are
                surrounded by national
                parks. We are also of course known for potatoes! </p>
